In normal operation of the switches of the switching arrangement, the power losses or heating of the switches depends upon the power being handled; during hard acceleration the power is high, and at constant speed on level ground the power is relatively small. Thus, the power "dissipated" by the switches varies with time. A cooling system transfers heat from the switching arrangement to ambient. During acceleration, the cooling system may not be able to limit the instantaneous temperature of the switches to the desired value. A phase-change heat "sink" coupled to the switches absorbs heat from the switches during hard acceleration, and returns the heat to the cooling system under more constant-speed conditions. In general, any electronic device which experiences transient power surges may use the same principle, thereby allowing the overall cooling system to be sized for average power, with the phase-change sink acting as an "integrator" to average the power by storing heat when the temperature tends to rise, and returning the heat when the temperature tends to fall. In an electric vehicle, braking is accomplished by returning energy to the battery, but when the battery is fully charged and can accept no more charge, braking may be accomplished by coupling the electric power to a cooled phase-change sink.

According to the method of the invention, the free end of the cable is initially extended from the cable spool and looped around the roller drum, and a tether provided on the trailer or jackstand is removably fastened to the free end portion of the cable on one side of the roller drum. As the all-terrain vehicle is driven away from the cable spool, the roller drum pulls the cable from the cable spool as the rotating cable spool dispenses the cable. After a selected length of cable has been removed from the cable spool, the all-terrain vehicle is stopped and re-positioned for pulling another segment of cable from the spool. The unwound segments of cable are positioned on the ground in parallel, adjacent relationship to each other and the procedure is repeated until the desired length of cable has been pulled from the cable spool.','Cable unwinding system and method','B2',14,'pg030429.zip',0);

Rather than seeking the optimum solution, which involves significant computational complexity, the present invention provides for a number of sub-optimal techniques for reducing the PAP of an OFDM signal but with much lower computational complexity. In particular, according to one embodiment utilizing the PTS approach, an iterative technique is used to assign phase factors to each of a set of partial transmit sequences from a set of possible phase factors. Experimental results using the iterative technique showed only a slight degradation (1 dB) from the optimal approach using the same number of subblocks and subcarriers. In an alternative embodiment, which avoids feedback required by the iterative approach, a sequence of phase factors are generated randomly and assigned to each of a set of partial transmit sequences. This procedure is repeated for a pre-determined number of trials and the random sequence generating the lowest PAP is selected.
